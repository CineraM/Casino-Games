C# program that has multiple casino games with a GUI (.net windows form app)
OOP-Based(Inheritance, Encapsulation)
The program lets you choose between 3 games, a dice simulator, black jack, poker, and roulette. 
The GUI has a flat modern design with a random multicolor theme that activates whenever you click a game button. Buttons are highlighted they are clicked.
